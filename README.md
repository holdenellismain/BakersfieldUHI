There seems to be no trend in the annual change in the magnitude of the heat island.

Suprisingly, the natural grassland was hotter than the urban area and agricultural land was far cooler due to irrigation. This is likely due to the effects of irrigated surfaces in the city such as lawns and golf courses offsetting the effect of paved surfaces.

Full results and discussion can be found in our [poster](Research Poster.pdf)
